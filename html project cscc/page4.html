                Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Abderrachid, a college student on a mission to make my mark in both the academic and sports worlds. High school was a whirlwind of experiences for me. I not only graduated but also had the privilege of leading my high school basketball team to a championship victory. Sports have taught me the values of teamwork, dedication, and perseverance, which I carry with me in everything I do.

                I'm not just about sports, though. I'm also a bit of a math enthusiast. During my high school years, I participated in several math olympics competitions and managed to clinch victory a few times. Solving complex problems and diving into the world of numbers is something I genuinely enjoy.

Now, in college, I'm even more driven and focused. My goal is to graduate with a deep understanding of my field and the skills required to create innovative software solutions that can change the way we live and work. The world of technology and innovation fascinates me, and I want to be a part of the change that makes a positive impact.
