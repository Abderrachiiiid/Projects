                Hey there, I'm Abderrachid, and my educational journey has been quite unique. I had the privilege of studying in three different languages because I attended school in two different countries. This experience not only expanded my language skills but also gave me a broader perspective on the world.

                Throughout my academic journey, I've always been known as a diligent and bright student, especially when it comes to mathematics. Math has been a constant love of mine, and I find it both fascinating and challenging. It's a skill I've honed over the years and one that I believe will serve me well as I pursue my dream of becoming a software engineer.

                Currently, I'm a student at Columbus State Community College, working towards my goal of entering the field of software engineering. This path excites me because it offers endless opportunities for creativity and problem-solving. I'm eager to dive into the world of coding and software development.

                Speaking of coding, I'm really passionate about programming. I'm currently enjoying my HTML course, and I must say, it's a beautiful subject. It's not only intriguing but also highly recommended for anyone aiming to work in web development.

                In a nutshell, my educational journey is characterized by my diverse language background, a strong inclination towards mathematics, and a clear vision of becoming a software engineer. My enthusiasm for programming, especially in HTML, keeps me motivated and driven as I continue on this exciting path.
